The Stealify Compiler Tooling

# DETERMENISTIC AOT Compiler

# AOT Compiler

# JIT Compiler

# Stealify Compiler
Stealify does introduse a new Compiler Paradigm compare able with the behavior of a multi pass AOT or JIT Compiler it can run in both modes
Stealify Compiler Toolkit uses AI Algorythms like bayesian to produce the correct result.

## What makes it diffrent?
It does not Compile CODE=>EXECUTEABLE it does Compile CODE=>RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENTS or to use a other Term Running Deployment. While it can be used to produce simple optimized Executables. 

lets look into a example:
rustc => ELF_BINARY (Linux)
Stealfiy Compiler => Docker,BAREMETAL,Cloud (Hybrid,Multi)
Stealify Compiler => AOT_BINARY_WITHRUNTIME
